# A Hybrid Method for Combining LSTM and Nearest Neighbor Approach for Image Captioning
We first individually implement the nearest neighbor approach and the neural network specifically, LSTM based approach to image captioning. We then propose a hybrid technique
to image captioning which is able to combine the best constituents of both the above models using logistic regression to produce higher quality captions that describe the images well. We have used the Flickr8k dataset. Our implementation of the nearest neighbor model achieves a BLEU-4 score of 15.95 and the neural network based model achieves a BLEU-4 score of 16.01. The proposed hybrid model is able to achieve a BLEU-4 score of 18.20 proving the validity of our approach.
This repository is the implementation of our Hybrid Model.
